Train your gatherers, dominate the fertile field!

This is a game where you can "teach" your gatherer to survive among ever growing fruits and other almost-friendly gatherers. This was created for an activity at workplace which ended up being superfun.

## About the game

Foods spawn, gatherers collect..\
They can collect and fill their bags,\
Or they can be a brute.. stun others and steal their food!\
Every action tires gatherers till they.. fall asleep.\
Those that DIGESTED the most food prevails the gathering :)

Every gatherer has a line of sight. They do not forget the fruit they see. But what they remember may be long gone (if there is at least one gatherer knows a location of a fruit which he/she has no sight to but is recently collected by someone else, fruit appears as a dot.. of disappointment)

Requires pygame and numpy\
Run thegathering_basic.py to test

## My own experience
Delivered "notes.pdf" and introduced the game to 8 teams consisting of ~30 engineers in total who knows programming but very little about python. Helped them write and test their own doctrine of gathering in ~15 mins. Then put them together to challenge each other. Great fun!
